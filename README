************ Compile Instructions *************
To compile successfully, you must have installed:

-armadillo, 
-fftw3, 
-gsl, 
-gtest,
-gmock,
-CMake. 

Usually both gtest and gmock are bundled with the compiler provided.
The program uses the 2014 c++ standards, although it also compiles with the 2011 standards. 

To compile, simply run

$ mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..

and wait for the CMake Makefile to be automatically generated. Then run:

$ make

to compile the main program binary and the test binary. To test if the installation was successful, run

$./IPT-test

You can also type in make test instead of the previous command to perform the tests, but it is executed with less verbosity.
